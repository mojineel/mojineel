- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mojineel
- Hi, I'm Mojtaba, a new member of GitHub. I hope we can have the power to solve all the problems together. I love the irregular and disjointed login system very much and I have a high and terrible power in this field. Exactly when I look in front of me and my hand is pointing to the right and the knife is in my left hand, I attack from behind and I don't follow any rules for penetration at all. Self-made and brutal rules. This was the initial plan. Now I have a plan with which a more advanced replacement can be placed next to the global system.
- I am Iranian, but I am looking for a way to open the borders of the Iranian global internet to build a new network in front of the internet. No one has the capital for this vast project, nor is I interested. I, Mojtaba, have burnt hands and extensive knowledge, even in what I do not know.
